## Quick start with amplify and appsync 

### `amplify installation` 

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

&& cd amplify-garphql-demo

npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react

```

### `Initialize new backend `
```
amplify init
```

* creates a directory called amplify that stores our backend definition. 
creates a file called aws-exports.js it that holds all the configuration for the services we create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
